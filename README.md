# Constituent Circle

AI-Enabled Tools for a Representative Democracy

## Introduction

Constituent Circle is a AI technology platform (CC) designed to enhance communication email, SMS and others between representatives and their constituents. By leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP), the CC platform enables representatives to craft personalized, on-message communications efficiently while maintaining their authentic voice and personal touch. The goal is to facilitate meaningful, goal-oriented conversations at scale, regardless of the channel, ensuring that constituents feel heard and represented.

## Features

- **Secure User Authentication**: Robust login system with support for multi-factor authentication.
- **Email Management**: Send and receive emails directly within the platform with seamless integration to external email services.
- **AI-Powered Response Suggestions**: Analyze constituent emails to generate personalized response templates.
- **Template Library**: Create and manage response templates categorized by topics.
- **Constituent Profile Management**: Maintain detailed profiles with interaction history.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Gain insights into email open rates, response rates, and common constituent concerns.

## Infrastructure Overview

### Serverless Architecture
The Constituent Circle platform leverages serverless architecture to enhance scalability and reduce operational overhead. By utilizing cloud functions, we can execute code in response to events without the need for server management. This allows for automatic scaling based on demand and efficient resource utilization.

### Key Components
- **Cloud Functions**:  
  - **AWS Lambda**: Executes backend code in response to events such as HTTP requests, database changes, or file uploads.  
  - **Google Cloud Functions**: Similar to AWS Lambda, allows for executing code in response to events in the Google Cloud ecosystem.  

### Benefits of Serverless Infrastructure
- **Scalability**: Automatically scales with the number of requests, ensuring optimal performance during peak usage.  
- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay only for the compute time used, reducing costs associated with idle server resources.  
- **Reduced Management Overhead**: Focus on writing code rather than managing servers, allowing for faster development cycles.

### Integration with Other Services
- **Database**: Integrate with Firestore or other databases to handle data storage and retrieval seamlessly.  
- **Monitoring**: Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor cloud functions and ensure system health.

## Development Setup

To start the development environment, use the following script:

```bash
./start_dev.sh
```

This script activates the virtual environment and starts the development server. Make sure to have your virtual environment set up before running this script.

You use the following command to run the Next.js development server:

   ```bash
   npx next dev
   ```

   This command starts the development server and enables hot-reloading for a smoother development experience.

- **To Access the application go to the following URL:**

   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

- **Login/Register**: Create an account or log in using your credentials.
- **Email Dashboard**: View, send, and receive emails within the platform.
- **AI Suggestions**: Receive AI-generated response suggestions for constituent emails.
- **Manage Templates**: Create, edit, and organize your response templates.
- **View Analytics**: Access the analytics dashboard to monitor engagement metrics.
